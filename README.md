# My-RCE-Scripts
These are my scripts that I wrote them for my job (Reverse Code Engineering) in Great ;) Python

In Scripts Name:
      When you have in this name as "My-Script-02" it mean this script tested in Python 2 and if it`s name is "My-Script-03.py" it mean it tested in Python 3.
      Some of scripts you can run them in 2 and 3. Their names as "My-Script.py".
                  
      Maybe you can see some script in my repo that they are available in some books as :
        "Hacking: The Art of Exploitation, by Jon Erickson","Reversing: Secrets of Reverse Engineering, by Eldad Eilam","The Shellcoders Handbook-Discovering and Exploiting Security Holes, by Chris Anley" and many other books.
        
      In here I should say that only I am a Security Enthusiast.
